## Project

DHGRAM – "Share & Message". A chat + thought-sharing platform: a public Thoughts
feed, one-to-one student Messages, and a Chat-with-Admin panel. React (Vite)
frontend + Express API. Frontend in `src/`, API in `server/`, Vercel serverless
entry in `api/index.js`.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` – API (:4000) + Vite (:5173) together
- `npm test` – vitest (spins up an in-memory MongoDB)
- `npm run lint` / `npm run typecheck` / `npm run build`
- `npm run seed:admin` – needs `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `npm run supabase:apply` – apply every `supabase/migrations/*.sql` to `SUPABASE_DB_URL`

## Data layer

Three interchangeable datastores. One env var switches **everything** (users,
OTPs, chats, messages, posts) and the others are not touched. Precedence is
Supabase > Sheets > MongoDB, decided by `datastore()` in `server/config.js`.

- MongoDB (default): Mongoose models in `server/models/`.
- Google Sheets: set `SHEETS_API_URL` + `SHEETS_API_TOKEN`.
- Supabase (Postgres): set `SUPABASE_DB_URL`. Tables are prefixed `app_` so they
  never collide with Supabase's own schemas.

The Sheets and Supabase drivers both mimic the Mongoose surface the routes use
(`find`, `findOne`, `create`, `save`, `populate`, `aggregate`), so routes are
driver-agnostic and models just pick an implementation:

- `server/sheets/odm.js` + `server/sheets/models.js` — over an Apps Script Web App
  (`google-apps-script/Code.gs`). `SheetsQuery` is shared: the Supabase ODM
  reuses it for chainable `sort`/`skip`/`limit`/`lean`.
- `server/supabase/odm.js` + `server/supabase/models.js` — over `pg`. Filters are
  compiled to parameterised SQL in `server/supabase/sql.js`; the column maps in
  `models.js` translate camelCase fields to snake_case columns.

See `docs/google-sheets.md` and `docs/supabase.md`. Keep the spreadsheet
**private** (Share ▸ Restricted): the Apps Script runs as its owner and reads it,
and every request is gated by a constant-time `SHEETS_TOKEN` check. Password
hashes and OTP codes are in the sheet, so link-sharing it would leak them. The
Supabase migration enables RLS with no policies, so the publishable key can read
nothing; the backend connects directly as Postgres, which bypasses RLS.

## Conventions

- API responses: `{ status, data }`; errors via `AppError` (operational → its
  status code, otherwise a generic 500 with no internals leaked).
- IDs: Mongo ObjectIds under MongoDB; the Sheet and Supabase use UUIDs, so
  validators accept either (`objectId` in `server/middleware/validate.js`).
- Compare ids with `String(a) === String(b)`, never `a.equals(b)` — the Sheets
  and Supabase drivers return plain strings.
- The Sheets and Supabase ODMs apply schema defaults (`spec.defaults`) and must
  resolve `findOne`/`findById` to a single document, not an array.
- Postgres needs `returning *` **after** any `on conflict` clause.
- Tests live in `server/tests/`; `sheets.test.js` runs the full app against a
  local in-memory fake of the Apps Script protocol, with no MongoDB, and
  `supabase.test.js` runs it against a real Postgres via `TEST_DATABASE_URL`
  (skipped when unset).

## Messages (student-to-student DMs)

- `server/routes/messages.js` + `server/models/PeerChat.js`; the conversation is
  keyed by the unordered pair (`pairFor`) so both directions share one thread.
- `server/routes/chat.js` purges peer messages older than
  `config.chat.retentionDays` (30) whenever a thread is read.
- The `/messages` sidebar lists **all other active students** (from
  `/messages/directory`) on top of existing conversations; picking someone with
  no thread calls `/messages/start` and opens it.

## Gotchas

- Apps Script POSTs answer 302 to `script.googleusercontent.com`; Node's fetch
  drops the body on redirect, so the client re-POSTs. Keep that behaviour.
- Frontend `useEffect` callbacks must not implicitly return a value that is not
  a function (React throws "destroy is not a function").
- The sandbox resets between sessions: Docker, MongoDB and the dev servers are
  gone on return and must be restarted.
