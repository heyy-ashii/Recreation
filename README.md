# OGEA — Share & Message

A chat and thought-sharing platform for students: a public **Thoughts** feed, one-to-one **Messages** between students, a built-in **Chat with Admin**, and an admin dashboard. Sign-up is by name + admission number on the student roster.

Created by **Ashique.Pilassery**.

One Vercel project serves both parts:

| Part | Tech | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | Vite · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS v4 · TanStack Query · React Router | `src/` → built to `dist/` |
| API | Express 5 · Mongoose (MongoDB) · JWT in HttpOnly cookie · Zod · Helmet · rate limiting · Nodemailer | `server/`, exposed by `api/index.js` at `/api/v1/*` |

Because the site and the API share one domain, there is no cross-site cookie/CORS setup to get wrong.

## Routes

**Public:** `/` · `/feed` (Thoughts) · `/messages` (one-to-one chat, signed-in) · `/about` · `/contact` · `/login` · `/signup` · `/account` (signed-in users)

Legacy `/discover`, `/programs/:id` and `/search` redirect to `/feed`.

**Admin (role `admin` only):** `/admin` (stats) · `/admin/users` (user table) · `/admin/chats` (chat inbox)

**API (`/api/v1`):**

| Area | Endpoints |
| --- | --- |
| Health | `GET /health` |
| Auth | `POST /auth/signup`, `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/logout`, `POST /auth/password/request-otp`, `POST /auth/password/reset`, `GET /auth/me`, `PATCH /auth/update-me`, `PATCH /auth/update-password` |
| Posts | `GET /posts`, signed-in: `POST /posts`, `PATCH /posts/:id`, `DELETE /posts/:id`, `POST /posts/:id/like` |
| Messages | signed-in: `GET /messages`, `GET /messages/directory`, `POST /messages/start`, `GET /messages/:id`, `POST /messages/:id`, `GET /messages/unread` |
| Admin | `GET /admin/stats`, `GET/POST /admin/users`, `PATCH/DELETE /admin/users/:id` |
| Chat | user: `GET /chat/me`, `GET /chat/me/unread`, `POST /chat/me/messages`; admin: `GET /chat/conversations`, `GET/POST /chat/conversations/:id/messages`, `PATCH /chat/conversations/:id` |

## Features

- **Thoughts:** any signed-in account can post text thoughts to the public feed, edit or delete their own, and like others' posts.
- **Messages:** signed-in students see **all other students** in the Messages sidebar (not just existing conversations) and start a one-to-one chat from there. The page is full-screen. Messages refresh by polling.
- **30-day retention:** messages older than `CHAT_RETENTION_DAYS` (30 by default) are deleted when a thread is read and by the daily cleanup cron.
- **Footer:** `ogea.sms@gmail.com` opens the mail app (`mailto:`); **Chat with Admin** opens the chat panel.
- **Chat with Admin:** signed-in users message the admins from any page; admins reply from `/admin/chats` and can mark conversations resolved.
- **Create Account:** on `/about`, `/login` or `/signup`. The student enters the name and admission number on the student list; a matching entry creates an account whose username is built from the name and whose initial password is the admission number. There is no email step.
- **Forgot password:** reset by emailed code.
- **Admin user table:** search, filter by role or status, add, edit, change role, enable or disable, reset password, delete. Passwords are bcrypt-hashed, so **nobody, admins included, can view an existing password**. An admin can only set a new one. Admins can't demote, disable or delete themselves.

## Security

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost 12); OTP codes hashed too, expire after 10 min, allow 5 attempts, have a 60 s resend cooldown, and can be used once.
- JWT in an `HttpOnly`, `Secure` (prod), `SameSite=Lax` cookie; tokens are invalidated after a password change or when the account is disabled.
- Sign-up always creates `role: user` (the request body can't set role).
- Rate limits on the whole API, plus stricter ones on login, OTP and chat; accounts lock for 15 min after 5 failed logins.
- Helmet headers, no `X-Powered-By`, CORS limited to an explicit allow-list (never reflects arbitrary origins).
- Input validation with Zod; invalid IDs return a clean 400/404; production errors never expose database internals.

## Local development

Requires Node 20+ (22 recommended).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # web on http://localhost:5173, API on http://localhost:4000 (proxied at /api)
```

Without `MONGODB_URI`, the dev server starts an **in-memory MongoDB** and seeds sample data plus two accounts:

| Username | Password | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `admin` | `admin12345` | admin |
| `student` | `student12345` | user |

These exist **only** in local dev with in-memory data. They are never created in production.

**OTP without SMTP:** if the `SMTP_*` variables aren't set, the code is printed in the API terminal (`[mail:dev] …`). Outside production, the sign-up form also shows it so you can test the flow end to end.

To use a real database locally, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in.

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run build        # type-check + production build
npm run lint         # oxlint
npm test             # API integration tests (in-memory MongoDB)
npm run seed:admin   # create/update an admin (see below)
```

## Deploying to Vercel

1. **MongoDB Atlas.** Create a cluster (the free M0 tier works) and a database user. Under *Network Access*, allow `0.0.0.0/0`, since Vercel uses dynamic IPs. Copy the connection string, e.g. `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster0.xxxx.mongodb.net/ogea`.
2. **Gmail App Password** (for email codes). Turn on 2-Step Verification for `ogea.sms@gmail.com`, then create an App Password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords.
3. **Import the repo.** In Vercel, click *Add New → Project* and pick this repo. Vercel detects **Vite** from `vercel.json`; leave the build settings at their defaults.
4. **Environment variables.** Add these under *Project → Settings → Environment Variables* (Production + Preview):

   | Name | Required | Value |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `MONGODB_URI` | yes | Atlas connection string |
   | `JWT_SECRET` | yes | random 64+ chars: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"` |
   | `SMTP_HOST` | for email OTP | `smtp.gmail.com` |
   | `SMTP_PORT` | for email OTP | `465` |
   | `SMTP_USER` | for email OTP | `ogea.sms@gmail.com` |
   | `SMTP_PASS` | for email OTP | the 16-char App Password |
   | `MAIL_FROM` | optional | `OGEA <ogea.sms@gmail.com>` |
   | `CORS_ORIGINS` | optional | only if another domain must call the API |

   > Without SMTP in production, sign-up codes only appear in *Vercel → Logs*. Set SMTP before you announce sign-ups.
5. **Deploy**, then open `https://<your-app>.vercel.app/api/v1/health`. It should return `{"status":"success","message":"OGEA API running"}`.
6. **Create the first admin** from your machine (once):
   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://..." ADMIN_USERNAME=ashique ADMIN_PASSWORD='a-strong-password' ADMIN_EMAIL=ogea.sms@gmail.com npm run seed:admin
   ```
   Running it again resets that admin's password.
7. **Custom domain** (optional): *Project → Settings → Domains*. Nothing else needs to change, because the API is same-origin.

### How it runs on Vercel

- `vercel.json` builds the SPA into `dist/`, rewrites `/api/*` to the single serverless function `api/index.js` (the Express app), and serves `index.html` for all other paths (client-side routing).
- The Mongo connection is cached on `globalThis`, so warm function calls reuse it.
- Hashed assets are cached for a year (`immutable`), and security headers are added to every response.

## Adding SMS later

Phone sign-up is intentionally deferred. To add it, pick a provider (MSG91, Fast2SMS, Twilio), add a `sendOtpSms()` next to `sendOtpEmail()` in `server/utils/email.js`, and accept `phone` as an alternative to `email` in `server/routes/auth.js` and the `Otp`/`User` models.
